# The Bitnami Library for Kubernetes

Popular applications, provided by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## TL;DR

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm search repo bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/<chart>
```

## Important notice: Helm v2 EOL :warning:

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support will formally end](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), Bitnami Helm Charts are going to be adapted to support the ability to implement the incorporation of different features added in Helm v3 and also to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

All the Bitnami Helm Charts are going to be updated in a major version applying the required changes, being the main one the update of the `apiVersion`. The current version of Bitnami Helm Charts use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), charts are going to be updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.

We will start moving the Bitnami Helm Charts (and deprecating Helm v2) on November 13th and we plan to have the whole catalog migrated before the 1st of December.

In the "Upgrade" section of every Helm Chart README, you will find the upgrade notes and instructions when a major version including those changes appeared.

## Before you begin

### Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

The quickest way to setup a Kubernetes cluster to install Bitnami Charts is following the "Bitnami Get Started" guides for the different services:

- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using VMware Enterprise PKS](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-charts-pks/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using VMware Tanzu Mission Control](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/tanzu-mission-control-get-started/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-aks/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-eks/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-gke/)
- [Get Started with Bitnami Charts using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/get-started-charts-iks/)

For setting up Kubernetes on other cloud platforms or bare-metal servers refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

### Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Add Repo

The following command allows you to download and install all the charts from this repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client, you can deploy a Bitnami Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise the [Using Helm Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

Useful Helm Client Commands:
* View available charts: `helm search repo`
* Install a chart: `helm install my-release bitnami/<package-name>`
* Upgrade your application: `helm upgrade`
